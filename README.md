# textpattern-curated-themes-list

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/textpattern/textpattern-curated-themes-list.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/textpattern/textpattern-curated-themes-list)

A curated list of [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com) themes listed in the [Textpattern themes website](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-themes-website).

## JSON structure

Each theme has a JSON-formatted 'library card', located within the `library-of-themes` directory of this repository.

The Textpattern themes website digests the information for each card to provide the relevant details of the theme. Each card expects a set of [required entries](#required-entries) plus any [optional entries](#optional-entries) as appropriate. **It is recommended** that you complete as many fields as possible in the JSON file, as this helps provide the most information to users within the Textpattern themes site and assists with ongoing maintenance.

```JSON
{
  "name": "example",
  "repositories": [
    {
      "repoType": "homepage",
      "repoUrl": "https://example.com/example-theme/"
    },
    {
      "repoType": "github",
      "repoUrl": "https://github.com/exampleuser/example-theme"
    },
    {
      "repoType": "bitbucket",
      "repoUrl": "https://bitbucket.org/exampleuser/example-theme"
    },
    {
      "repoType": "gitlab",
      "repoUrl": "https://gitlab.com/exampleuser/example-theme"
    }
  ],
  "version": "2.2.0",
  "datePublished": "2020-09-04",
  "downloadUrl": "https://example.com/example-theme/download.zip",
  "demoUrl": "https://example.com/example-theme/demo/",
  "require": {
    "abc_example1": ">=2.0.0",
    "abc_example2": "1.5.1"
  }
}
```

A [JSON template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/textpattern/textpattern-curated-themes-list/master/template.json) is provided as a useful starting point.

### Required entries

* `name`:\
  The name of the theme.
* `version`:\
  Latest theme version number in `semver` format (e.g. `1.3.8`).
* `downloadUrl`:\
  A URL endpoint to download the latest theme versionâ€™s source code (in `.zip` format).

### Example minimum structure

This is the minimum that is required in each JSON file:

```JSON
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "2.2.0",
  "downloadUrl": "https://example.com/example-theme/download.zip"
}
```

### Optional (but recommended) entries

* `repositories`:\
  One or more code repositories where the the project is maintained. For each entry, a `repoType` and `repoUrl` must be provided. For `repoType` expected values are either `homepage` (i.e. page on an author's website specifically about the plugin), `github`, `bitbucket` or `gitlab`.
* `datePublished`:\
  Release date (in ISO 8601 `yyyy-mm-dd` format) of latest theme version.
* `require`:\
  If this theme requires one or more specific plugins to be installed in order to work, state the plugins and version requirements.

### Linting

You can run a linter over the JSON files to check validity as follows (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)):

```ShellSession
$ cd textpattern-curated-themes-list
$ npm install
$ npm run jsonlint
```
